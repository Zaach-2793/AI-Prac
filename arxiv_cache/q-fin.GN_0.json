It lies in FUNDAMENTAL IMPOSSIBILITY of\nobjectively evaluating tax base. Distortions can be entirely avoided in the\nsector of publicly traded corporations. Evaluation can be bypassed by taxing it\nin shares (to be auctioned) rather than cash.\n  Stock capital includes cost basis (B) and unrealized gains (G). Gains are\npresently tax-deferred until realized in divestment. The deferral is remedied\nby corporate income tax (rate t). i is the variable interest rate on special\nconstant value \"cv-bonds\".\n  The proposed system replaces (1) corporate income tax - with interest on the\ndeferred G*t, and (2) divestment taxes - with interest on B*t. To collect both,\nIRS will periodically take to auction a fraction i*t of privately held publicly\ntraded shares. Note: (2) is a neutral simplification: Investments can be split\ninto B(1-t) stock and B*t in bond portfolios. Bond interest buys back the\nauctioned shares, and tax-free divestment matches the original yield.\n  The i*t stock tax matches the income tax on cv-bond portfolios of equal\nvalue. The Treasury, too, could match its income (in bond sales) to the rate t\ntax on the full stock market return (without tempting price manipulation). It\ncan vary i to keep the bond volume at a fraction t of market capitalization;\nthen share auctions supply bond interest. Taxpayers, too, could unilaterally\nmatch their burden to such tax by keeping a fraction t of capital in bonds.\n  The main feature is: nothing companies and investors do can change their tax\n(fraction i*t of shares), so business decisions would be exactly the same as\nwithout taxes. No longer would taxes on dividends and capital gains impede\ncapital flow, companies would forget bewildering mazes of tax laws,\nregulations, precedents; Congress would still collect the same revenue it now\ndoes.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Leonid A.

We find that mean year profits are\nproportional to mean year revenues, exception made for few anomalous years,\nfrom which we postulate a linear relation between company expected mean profit\nand revenue. Mean annual revenues are used to scale both company profits and\nrevenues. Annual profit fluctuations are obtained as difference between actual\nannual profit and its expected mean value, scaled by a power of the revenue to\nget a stationary behavior as a function of revenue. We find that profit\nfluctuations are broadly distributed having approximate power-law tails with a\nLevy-type exponent $\\alpha \\simeq 1.7$, from which we derive the associated\nbreak-even probability distribution.

However, few models satisfactorily resolve the core problem of allowing\nboth the source and receiving divisions to earn a profit on transfers during a\nperiod in such a way that sub-optimal output levels are avoided. In 1969,\nSamuel proposed to use a transfer price schedule instead of just a single\ntransfer price. An essential improvement of Samuels' model was given by Tomkins\n(1990) in his pragmatic-analytical transfer pricing approach, which is a\ncombination of a single cost-plus transfer price and the pragmatic process of\nnegotiation. This fundamental approach was developed under the assumption that\nthe net average revenue curve for the final product is linear.\n  In this paper, Tomkins' pragmatic-analytical model is further developed for\nnon-linear net average revenue curves. In particular, typical quadratic\nfunctions are considered and corresponding transfer price schedules are\ndetermined. A similar technique can be used for the transfer pricing problem\nwith any net average revenue curve.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>S.

Asset backed securities have been\nextensively criticised for creating a moral hazard in loan issuance and an\nassociated increase in default risk, by removing the immediate lender's\nincentive to ensure that the underlying loans could be repaid. However\nsignificant monetary issues can accompany any form of increased commercial bank\nlending, and these appear to have been overlooked by this analysis. In this\npaper we propose a general explanation for credit crises based on an\nexamination of the mechanics of the banking system, and in particular its\ninternal controls on the supply of credit. We suggest that the current credit\ncrisis is the result of multiple failures in the Basel regulatory framework,\nincluding the removal of central bank reserve requirements from some classes of\ndeposit accounts within the banking system, allowing financial instruments\nrepresenting debt to be used as regulatory capital, and in particular the\nintroduction of securitized lending which effectively removed a previously\nimplicit control over the total quantity of lending originating from the\nbanking system. We further argue that the interaction of these problems has led\nto a destabilising imbalance between total money and loan supply growth, in\nthat total lending sourced from the commercial bank sector increased at a\nfaster rate than accompanying growth in the money supply. This not only created\na multi-decade macro-economic debt spiral, but by increasing the ratio of debt\nto money within the monetary system acted to increase the risk of loan\ndefaults, and consequentially reduce the overall stability of the banking\nsystem.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Jacky Mallett</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">19 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for Publication in Advances in Complex\n  Systems, August 2nd 2012</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1426v4\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.1426v4\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.3929v2</id>\n    <updated>2009-04-25T05:57:39Z</updated>\n    <published>2009-04-24T19:41:29Z</published>\n    <title>La Loi organique relative aux lois de finances (LOLF) dans les\n  institutions culturelles publiques du spectacle vivant en France</title>\n    <summary>  In a crisis of public finances, France bases all its hopes on the \"evaluation\nof performance\" to moderate the effects of a complex crisis.

This model is quite simple and can be treated\nanalytically since the buyers evaluate the quality of a certain good taking\ninto account only the quality of the last good purchased plus her perceptive\ncapacity \\beta . As a consequence the system evolves according to a stationary\nMarkovian stochastic process. The value of a product offered by the seller\nincreases with quality according to the exponent \\alpha, which is a measure of\ntechnology. It incorporates all the technological capacity of production\nsystems such as education, scientific development and techniques that change\nthe productivity growth. The technological level plays an important role to\nexplain how the asymmetry of information may affect the market evolution in\nthis model. We observe that, for high technological levels, the market can\ncontrol adverse selection. The model allows us to compute the maximum\nasymmetric information degree before market collapse. Below this critical point\nthe market evolves during a very limited time and then dies out completely.\nWhen \\beta is closer to 1(symmetric information), the market becomes more\nprofitable for high quality goods, although high and low quality markets\ncoexist. All the results we obtained from the model are analytical and the\nmaximum asymmetric information level is a consequence of an ergodicity\nbreakdown in the process of quality evaluation.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Paulo F.

This model is estimated for 30\ncountries (10 developed countries and 20 emerging countries) using panel data\neconometrics. In order to investigate whether the financial integration in\nemerging markets and that in developed markets react differently to the\neconomic and financial innovations, we estimated the model as well jointly for\nall markets as separately for developed markets and emerging markets. Our\nresults show that trade openness exerts a positive effect on financial\nintegration across all markets, the global factors drive integration in\ndeveloped markets whereas the factors related to economic and political\nstability affect financial integration in emerging markets.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Mohamed El Hedi Arouri</name>\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">LEO</arxiv:affiliation>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3871v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.3871v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3873v1</id>\n    <updated>2009-05-24T05:13:35Z</updated>\n    <published>2009-05-24T05:13:35Z</published>\n    <title>Structural Breaks in the Mexico's Integration into the World Stock\n  Market</title>\n    <summary>  This article investigates the evolution of the Mexican stock market\nintegration into the world market.

Such a market allows market participants to assume a\nstake in a security whose value is tied to a future event. We propose that\nsecurities are created whose value hinges on the transfer amount paid for loans\nfrom NAMA to a bank. In essence, bets are accepted on whether the price is\nhigher or lower than a certain quoted figure. The prices of the securities\nrepresent transfer prices for toxic assets increases or decreases in line with\nmarket opinion. Prediction markets offer a proven means of aggregating\ndistributed knowledge pertaining to fair market values in a scalable and\ntransparent manner. They are incentive compatible (i.e. induce truthful\nreporting) and robust to strategic manipulation. We propose that a prediction\nmarket is run in parallel with the pricing procedure recommended by the\nEuropean Commission. This procedure need not necessarily take heed of the\nprediction markets view in all cases but it may offer guidance and a means of\nanomaly detection.

The agents have different beliefs about the dynamics of the\nunobserved process and therefore form different estimates. We analyse this\nmodel and derive the state price density.

Because of the heterogeneity of the\nrational agents' expectations, there is a synchronization problem for the\noptimal exit times determined by these arbitrageurs, which leads to the\nsurvival of the bubble almost all the way to its theoretical end time. The\nexplicit exact analytical solutions of the two models provide nonlinear\ntransformations which allow us to develop novel tests for the presence of\nbubbles in financial time series. Avoiding the difficult problem of parameter\nestimation of the stochastic differential equation describing the price\ndynamics, the derived operational procedures allow us to diagnose bubbles that\nare in the making and to forecast their termination time.

These models provide an accurate description of\ndisinflation in the 1990s and a deflationary period in the 2000s. In Japan,\nthere exists a statistically reliable (R2=0.68) Phillips curve, which is\ncharacterized by a negative relation between inflation and unemployment and\ntheir synchronous evolution: UE(t) = -0.94p(t) + 0.045. Effectively, growing\nunemployment has resulted in decreasing inflation since 1982. A linear and\nlagged generalized relationship between inflation, unemployment and labor force\nhas been also obtained for Japan: p(t) = 2.8*dLF(t)/LF(t) + 0.9*UE(t) - 0.0392.\nLabor force projections allow a prediction of inflation and unemployment in\nJapan: CPI inflation will be negative (between -0.5% and -1% per year) during\nthe next 40 years. Unemployment will increase from ~4.0% in 2010 to 5.3% in\n2050.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Ivan O.

We explore a method of\nimposing diversity on market models by a type of antitrust regulation that is\ncompatible with EMMs. The regulatory procedure breaks up companies that become\ntoo large, while holding the total number of companies constant by imposing a\nsimultaneous merge of other companies. The regulatory events are assumed to\nhave no impact on portfolio values. As an example, regulation is imposed on a\nmarket model in which diversity is maintained via a log-pole in the drift of\nthe largest company. The result is the removal of arbitrage opportunities from\nthis market while maintaining the market's diversity.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Winslow Strong</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Jean-Pierre Fouque</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1007/s10436-010-0175-1</arxiv:doi>\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10436-010-0175-1\" rel=\"related\"/>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">21 pages</arxiv:comment>\n    <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Annals of Finance, Vol. 7, No. 3, 349-374, 2011</arxiv:journal_ref>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5650v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.5650v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"91G10 (Primary), 91B70, 60G44 (Secondary)\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5926v2</id>\n    <updated>2011-03-13T16:09:49Z</updated>\n    <published>2010-03-30T21:19:31Z</published>\n    <title>Diagnosis and Prediction of Market Rebounds in Financial Markets</title>\n    <summary>  We introduce the concept of \"negative bubbles\" as the mirror image of\nstandard financial bubbles, in which positive feedback mechanisms may lead to\ntransient accelerating price falls. To model these negative bubbles, we adapt\nthe Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model of rational expectation bubbles with a\nhazard rate describing the collective buying pressure of noise traders. The\nprice fall occurring during a transient negative bubble can be interpreted as\nan effective random downpayment that rational agents accept to pay in the hope\nof profiting from the expected occurrence of a possible rally. We validate the\nmodel by showing that it has significant predictive power in identifying the\ntimes of major market rebounds. This result is obtained by using a general\npattern recognition method which combines the information obtained at multiple\ntimes from a dynamical calibration of the JLS model. Error diagrams, Bayesian\ninference and trading strategies suggest that one can extract genuine\ninformation and obtain real skill from the calibration of negative bubbles with\nthe JLS model. We conclude that negative bubbles are in general predictably\nassociated with large rebounds or rallies, which are the mirror images of the\ncrashes terminating standard bubbles.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Wanfeng Yan</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Ryan Woodard</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Didier Sornette</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">49 pages, 14 figures</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5926v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.5926v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0682v1</id>\n    <updated>2010-04-05T19:07:57Z</updated>\n    <published>2010-04-05T19:07:57Z</published>\n    <title>L'effet de levier de tr\u00e9sorerie</title>\n    <summary>  The effect of leverage on liquidity is a tool for analysing the level of\nliquidity for a given production process. It measures the sensitivity of the\nlevel of liquidity that results from changes in the volume of production and\nunit operating margin. A commercial activity is liquid at the moment when all\ncosts are covered by revenues. However, not all of the cash flows from\nproduction influence liquidity levels. The estimated costs do not directly\ninfluence the level of liquidity. Therefore, two indicators are to be taken\ninto consideration: the elasticity of ongoing liquidity - fixed costs include\nestimated costs, and, the elasticity of immediate liquidity - fixed costs only\ninclude costs that are payable. The coefficients of leverage of ongoing\nliquidity and of leverage of immediate liquidity in relation to the operating\nmargin have a behaviour that is identical to that calculated in relation to\nproduction. If the productive capacity remains unchanged, the regulation of the\nchange in elasticity of the costs and of its influence on the unitary operating\nmargin is the sole parameter available to the entrepreneur to maintain the\nliquidity of the company at the desired level. But, if the productive capacity\nis variable, the entrepreneur can use the volume of sales to control liquidity\nbut then the transformation of the production process must be analysed so as to\nadjust the relevant elements to retain in the operating structure the degree of\nliquidity wished for.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Jean-Claude Juhel</name>\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">CRIFP</arxiv:affiliation>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">La Revue du Financier Septembre-d\\'ecembre, Num\\'ero 173-174\n  (2008) 16 - 46</arxiv:journal_ref>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0682v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.0682v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0844v1</id>\n    <updated>2010-04-02T06:14:37Z</updated>\n    <published>2010-04-02T06:14:37Z</published>\n    <title>Quantum Portfolios of Observables and the Risk Neutral Valuation Model</title>\n    <summary>  Quantum Portfolios of quantum algorithms encoded on qbits have recently been\nreported.

It is based upon the works of\nthis author but particularly on his \"Manuel du sp\\'eculateur \\`a la Bourse\"\n(Stock Market Speculator Manual) edited in 1857 in Paris. Compared to the\nmarkets of today, however, the stock market described by Proudhon appears\nembryonic. Nevertheless it represents the location for transactions in\nfinancial assets, commodities, precious metals and even some transactions\ninvolving options. This contribution is organised in the following manner - the\nfirst section is devoted to the development of Proudhon's thought in relation\nto speculation. It is divided into two parts. The first part is dedicated to\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon's definitions of stock market speculation or gambling\nwith shares that for him served no purpose either from a human or economic\nperspective and was therefore condemnable and to be contrasted with\nentrepreneurial speculation that, even though it is a highly-risky activity,\ninvolves the spirit of enterprise and provides the lifeblood of economic\ngrowth. The second part allows us to present Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's\npropositions in relation to restricting the speculation that he considers\nobnoxious. The second section has two objectives: one part places in\nperspective the views of Proudhon and the characteristics of stock market\nactivity under the Second Empire whilst the other part examines current-day\naspects of the characteristics evoked by Proudhon. We are interested especially\nin the question of the regulation and that of the relevance today of certain\naccounting practices.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Jean-Claude Juhel</name>\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">CRIFP</arxiv:affiliation>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Dominique Dufour</name>\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">CRIFP</arxiv:affiliation>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">12th World Congress of Accounting Historians, Istanbul : Turkey\n  (2008)</arxiv:journal_ref>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0221v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.0221v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0496v5</id>\n    <updated>2014-04-09T15:25:58Z</updated>\n    <published>2010-05-04T11:47:10Z</published>\n    <title>Stable-1/2 Bridges and Insurance</title>\n    <summary>  We develop a class of non-life reserving models using a stable-1/2 random\nbridge to simulate the accumulation of paid claims, allowing for an essentially\narbitrary choice of a priori distribution for the ultimate loss. Taking an\ninformation-based approach to the reserving problem, we derive the process of\nthe conditional distribution of the ultimate loss. The \"best-estimate ultimate\nloss process\" is given by the conditional expectation of the ultimate loss. We\nderive explicit expressions for the best-estimate ultimate loss process, and\nfor expected recoveries arising from aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance\ntreaties. Use of a deterministic time change allows for the matching of any\ninitial (increasing) development pattern for the paid claims. We show that\nthese methods are well-suited to the modelling of claims where there is a\nnon-trivial probability of catastrophic loss. The generalized inverse-Gaussian\n(GIG) distribution is shown to be a natural choice for the a priori ultimate\nloss distribution. For particular GIG parameter choices, the best-estimate\nultimate loss process can be written as a rational function of the paid-claims\nprocess. We extend the model to include a second paid-claims process, and allow\nthe two processes to be dependent. The results obtained can be applied to the\nmodelling of multiple lines of business or multiple origin years. The\nmulti-dimensional model has the property that the dimensionality of\ncalculations remains low, regardless of the number of paid-claims processes. An\nalgorithm is provided for the simulation of the paid-claims processes.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Edward Hoyle</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Lane P.

In this paper we use data for a variety of\nE.U. countries: both EMU (Germany, France, Italy) and non-EMU members (Sweden\nand the U.K.). The data used range from 1991:Q1 to 2009:Q1. For each country,\nwe extract the long run trend and the cyclical component of real economic\nactivity, while the corresponding interbank interest rates of long and short\nterm maturities are used for the calculation of the country specific yield\nspreads. We also augment the models tested with non monetary policy variables:\nthe countries' unemployment rates and stock indices. The methodology employed\nin the effort to forecast real output, is a probit model of the inverse\ncumulative distribution function of the standard distribution, using several\nformal forecasting and goodness of fit evaluation tests. The results show that\nthe yield curve augmented with the non-monetary variables has significant\nforecasting power in terms of real economic activity but the results differ\nqualitatively between the individual economies examined raising non-trivial\npolicy implications.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Periklis Gogas</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Ioannis Pragidis</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1326v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.1326v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1917v1</id>\n    <updated>2010-05-11T19:27:18Z</updated>\n    <published>2010-05-11T19:27:18Z</published>\n    <title>Two-sided estimates for stock price distribution densities in\n  jump-diffusion models</title>\n    <summary>  We consider uncorrelated Stein-Stein, Heston, and Hull-White models and their\nperturbations by compound Poisson processes with jump amplitudes distributed\naccording to a double exponential law. Similar perturbations of the\nBlack-Scholes model were studied by S. Kou. For perturbed stochastic volatility\nmodels, we obtain two-sided estimates for the stock price distribution density\nand compare the tail behavior of this density before and after perturbation. It\nis shown that if the value of the parameter, characterizing the right tail of\nthe double exponential law, is small, then the stock price density in the\nperturbed model decays slower than the density in the original model. On the\nother hand, if the value of this parameter is large, then there are no\nsignificant changes in the behavior of the stock price distribution density.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Archil Gulisashvili</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Josep Vives</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1917v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.1917v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3518v1</id>\n    <updated>2010-05-19T18:44:53Z</updated>\n    <published>2010-05-19T18:44:53Z</published>\n    <title>Inequality reversal: effects of the savings propensity and correlated\n  returns</title>\n    <summary>  In the last decade, a large body of literature has been developed to explain\nthe universal features of inequality in terms of income and wealth. By now, it\nis established that the distributions of income and wealth in various economies\nshow a number of statistical regularities. There are several models to explain\nsuch static features of inequality in an unifying framework and the kinetic\nexchange models, in particular, provide one such framework. Here we focus on\nthe dynamic features of inequality. In the process of development and growth,\ninequality in an economy in terms of income and wealth follows a particular\npattern of rising in the initial stage followed by an eventual fall. This\ninverted U-shaped curve is known as the Kuznets Curve. We examine the\npossibilities of such behavior of an economy in the context of a generalized\nkinetic exchange model. It is shown that under some specific conditions, our\nmodel economy indeed shows inequality reversal.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Anindya S.

Agents are linked by productive and credit relationships so\nthat the behavior of one agent influences the behavior of the others through\nnetwork connections. Credit interlinkages among agents are a source of\nbankruptcy diffusion: in fact, failure of fulfilling debt commitments would\nlead to bankruptcy chains. All in all, the bankruptcy in one sector can diffuse\nto other sectors through linkages creating a vicious cycle and bankruptcy\navalanches in the network economy. Our analysis show how the choices of credit\nsupply by both banks and firms are interrelated. While the initial impact of\nmonetary policy is on bank behaviour, we show the interactive play between the\nchoices made by banks, the choices made by firms in their role as providers of\ncredit, and the choices made by firms in their role as producers.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Domenico Delli Gatti</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Mauro Gallegati</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Bruce Greenwald</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Alberto Russo</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Joseph E.

Since the traditional approach performed by Economics or\nFinance has revealed to be insufficient in fully characterizing and explaining\nthe correspondingly phenomena, we discuss whether Econophysics can provide a\nnew insight onto these matters. Thus, an assessment is presented in order to\nweight its potential opportunities and limitations. This is particularly\nrelevant as it is widely recognized that during its yet short existence\nEconophysics has experienced a growing interest not only by physicists but also\nby economists in searching for new approaches that could help explaining\nexisting questions. In fact, many papers have been submitted, some books have\nbeen released, new journals have been published, several conferences have been\nheld, a site is maintained -- http://www.unifr.ch/econophysics where news,\nevents, book reviews, papers and a blog are exhibited; a 3-year licentiate\nstudies (University of Silesia [1]) and a B.Sc. course (University of Wroclaw\n[2]) have been created and also some Ph.D. thesis have been written. Therefore,\na fundamental question arises: Is this just a fad or is it something much more\nconsistent that will prevail? This is what this paper addresses.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Sonia R.

As a result, appearance of economic crisis is determined by two\npoints; that is, (a). Stock market approaches perfect competition; (b). Society\nreaches full employment. The empirical research of these two points would lead\nto early warning of economic crisis. Moreover, it is a surprise that the state\nof economic crisis would be a feasible equilibrium within the framework of the\nArrow-Debreu model. That means that we can not understand the origin of\neconomic crisis within the framework of modern economics, for example, the\ngeneral equilibrium theory.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Yong Tao</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">4 pages</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5154v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.5154v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.GN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.6050v1</id>\n    <updated>2010-10-28T18:54:41Z</updated>\n    <published>2010-10-28T18:54:41Z</published>\n    <title>Entering New Markets-a Challenge in Times of Crisis</title>\n    <summary>  After September 2008, the advanced economies severe decline caused demand for\nemerging economies' exports to drop and the crisis became truly global, much\ndeeper and broader than expected. In these times of global depression, most\ncountries and companies are affected, some more than others. The financial\ncrisis has turned out to be much deeper and broader than expected.

For this purpose, the case of\nElectroputere S.A., the old Romanian producer of railway equipment, has been\nchosen.
