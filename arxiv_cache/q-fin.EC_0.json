However there\nis currently a desire to see the region transition towards a more bio-based\neconomy. New bio-related industries are being situated in the region as a\nconsequence of policy and economic incentives. Many of these industries are\nconnected through their supply chains, either directly, or by sharing common\nsuppliers or customers and the growth or decline of one industry can hence have\nimpacts on many others. Therefore an important question to consider is what\neffect this movement towards bio-based industry will actually have on the\nregional economy as a whole. In this paper we develop a general abstract\ndynamical model for the metabolic interactions of firms or industries. This\ndynamical model has been applied to the Humber region in order to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of how the region may develop. The model suggests that the\ntransition to a bio-based economy will occur with oil refining losing its\ndominance to bioethanol production and biological chemical production, whilst\nanaerobic digestion grows as a major source of electricity, in turn driving up\nthe value of regional waste aggregators and arable farming in the overall\neconomy.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Christopher J.

Firstly, ad hoc and\nquasi-optimal rules parameters of financial stability indicators cannot be\nidentified. For those rules, non zero policy rule parameters of financial\nstability indicators are observationally equivalent to rule parameters set to\nzero in another rule, so that they are unable to inform monetary policy.\nSecondly, under controllability conditions, optimal policy rules parameters of\nfinancial stability indicators can all be identified, along with a bounded\nsolution stabilizing an unstable economy as in Woodford (2003), with\ndeterminacy of the initial conditions of non- predetermined variables.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Jean-Bernard Chatelain</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Kirsten Ralf</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">18 pages</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3347v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.3347v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7377v1</id>\n    <updated>2014-04-28T08:15:57Z</updated>\n    <published>2014-04-28T08:15:57Z</published>\n    <title>The Italian Crisis and Producer Households Debt: a Source of Stability?\n  A Reproducible Research</title>\n    <summary>  The European Credit Research Institute Research Report 2013 identifies\nHouseholds debt \"rapid increase and abrupt retrenchment\" among the causes of\nmacroeconomic instability in the European Union after 2008. In our research: i)\nwe accessed the Bank of Italy Online Statistical Database on Customers and Risk\nfor Producer Households and Non-Financial Corporations with R Sweave open\naccess statistical software, which makes our analysis freely reproducible by\nother researchers; ii) we subset the European System of Accounts sector\nHouseholds into the Bank of Italy sub-sectors Households and Producer\nHouseholds, which are market producing entities limited to informal\npartnerships, de facto companies and sole proprietorships with up to five\nemployees and iii) we tested the hypothesis of \"rapid increase and abrupt\nretrenchment\" of debt for this subset in Italy for the period 1996-2013. We\nfound that PH debt (bad debt) has been more stable with a lower Variation\nCoefficient of 10.3% (14.2%) versus 13.2% (20.1%) in NFC. We also found that\nthe time series of the ratio of debt granted to NFC (numerator) versus PH\n(denominator) is best described (Multiple Squared 0.95) by the concavity of the\n5th degree coefficient (slope -1.22; 95% CI -1.52 - -0.91) of a 5th order\npolynomial linear regression and by the convexity of the 2nd degree coefficient\n(slope 4.26; 95% CI 2.53 - 5.99) for bad debt (Multiple R Squared 0.47), with\nthis concavity of debt and convexity of bad debt beginning with the Italian\ncrisis in the second trimester of 2008. We reject the hypothesis (p &lt; 0.01) of\n\"rapid increase and abrupt retrenchment\" of debt for the subset Producer\nHouseholds during the Italian Crisis.

We give positive\nanswers to both questions. To achieve these results, we first show that there\nis a classical solution to the HJB equation and give a representation of the\nsolution in terms of the dual function of the solution to the dual HJB\nequation. We demonstrate the usefulness of that representation with some\nnontrivial examples that would be difficult to solve with the trial and error\nmethod. We then combine the dual method and the partial differential equation\nmethod to give a direct proof to the turnpike property and to estimate the\nerror and the convergence rate of the optimal policy when the utility function\nis continuously differentiable and strictly concave. We finally relax the\nconditions of the utility function and provide some sufficient conditions that\nguarantee the turnpike property and the convergence rate in terms of both\nprimal and dual utility functions.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Baojun Bian</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Harry Zheng</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29 pages</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7802v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.7802v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0249v2</id>\n    <updated>2014-12-12T11:35:10Z</updated>\n    <published>2014-10-01T14:57:49Z</published>\n    <title>On the convergence of the Fitness-Complexity Algorithm</title>\n    <summary>  We investigate the convergence properties of an algorithm which has been\nrecently proposed to measure the competitiveness of countries and the quality\nof their exported products. These quantities are called respectively Fitness F\nand Complexity Q. The algorithm was originally based on the adjacency matrix M\nof the bipartite network connecting countries with the products they export,\nbut can be applied to any bipartite network. The structure of the adjacency\nmatrix turns to be essential to determine which countries and products converge\nto non zero values of F and Q. Also the speed of convergence to zero depends on\nthe matrix structure. A major role is played by the shape of the ordered matrix\nand, in particular, only those matrices whose diagonal does not cross the empty\npart are guaranteed to have non zero values as outputs when the algorithm\nreaches the fixed point. We prove this result analytically for simplified\nstructures of the matrix, and numerically for real cases.

Second, by allowing the\nsubstitutions to be incomplete, we extend the one-dimensional process to a\ntree-form multidimensional one featuring diversification throughout the\nlong-term development.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Shidong Wang</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Renaud Foucart</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Cheng Wan</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">26 pages, 4 figures</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2167v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2167v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3078v6</id>\n    <updated>2016-10-04T02:26:00Z</updated>\n    <published>2014-11-12T05:43:35Z</published>\n    <title>Long Term Risk: A Martingale Approach</title>\n    <summary>  This paper extends the long-term factorization of the stochastic discount\nfactor introduced and studied by Alvarez and Jermann (2005) in discretetime\nergodic environments and by Hansen and Scheinkman (2009) and Hansen (2012) in\nMarkovian environments to general semimartingale environments. The transitory\ncomponent discounts at the stochastic rate of return on the long bond and is\nfactorized into discounting at the long-term yield and a positive\nsemimartingale that extends the principal eigenfunction of Hansen and\nScheinkman (2009) to the semimartingale setting. The permanent component is a\nmartingale that accomplishes a change of probabilities to the long forward\nmeasure, the limit of T-forward measures. The change of probabilities from the\ndata generating to the long forward measure absorbs the long-term risk-return\ntrade-off and interprets the latter as the long-term risk-neutral measure.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Likuan Qin</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Vadim Linetsky</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3078v6\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.3078v6\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05283v2</id>\n    <updated>2015-03-22T04:58:52Z</updated>\n    <published>2015-03-18T04:58:18Z</published>\n    <title>Re-visiting the Distance Coefficient in Gravity Model</title>\n    <summary>  This paper revisits the classic gravity model in international trade and\nreexamines the distance coefficient.

Our results confirm this point in the sense that the\ncoefficient has been very stable between 1991-2006, despite the obvious\ntechnological progress taken place during this period. Moreover, by comparing\nthe sensitivity of these coefficients to change in oil prices at short periods\nof time, in which technology remained unchanged, we conclude that the average\ntechnology has indeed reduced the average trading cost.

We develop a multidimensional computational model to examine how\nuncertainties and risks in the economic and climate systems affect the social\ncost of carbon (SCC)---that is, the present value of the marginal damage to\neconomic output caused by carbon emissions. The SCC is substantially increased\nby economic and climate risks at both current and future times. Furthermore,\nthe SCC is itself a stochastic process with significant variation; for example,\nthe basic elements of risk incorporated into our model cause the SCC in 2100 to\nbe, with significant probability, ten times what it would be without those\nrisks. We have only imprecise information about what parameter values are best\nfor approximating reality. To deal with this parametric uncertainty we perform\nextensive uncertainty quantification and show that these findings are robust\nfor a wide range of alternative specifications. More generally, this work shows\nthat large-scale computing can enable economists to examine substantially more\ncomplex and realistic models for the purposes of policy analysis.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Yongyang Cai</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Kenneth L.

The process\nis thereby seen as a chain of subsequently arranged units with random\nparameters influencing the objective function. For solving such complex chain\nproblems, analytical methods usually fail and statistical methods only provide\napproximate solutions while requiring massive computing power. We took insights\nfrom physics to develop a new methodology based on homogenization and\nclustering. The core idea is to replace the complex real chain with a virtual\nchain that homogenizes the involved parameters and clusters the working units\ninto global units to facilitate computation. This methodology drastically\nreduces computing time, allows for the derivation of analytical formulas, and\nprovides fast and objective insights about the optimization problem under\ninvestigation. We illustrate the analytical potency of this methodology by\napplying it to the production problem of selecting the economically superior\nquality maintenance strategy. It can further be applied to all sequential\nmulti-parametrical chain problems commonly found in business.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Johannes Freiesleben</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Nicolas Gu\u00e9rin</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">32 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, full paper</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03874v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03874v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03956v1</id>\n    <updated>2015-05-15T04:26:41Z</updated>\n    <published>2015-05-15T04:26:41Z</published>\n    <title>From 0D to 1D spatial models using OCMat</title>\n    <summary>  We show that the standard class of optimal control models in OCMat can be\nused to analyze 1D spatial distributed systems.

Such an\nevolution of carbon price is generally associated with economically efficient\nclimate change mitigation, and would provide incentives for the land-owner for\nenhanced carbon sequestration. With an infinitely long sequence of even-aged\nforest rotations, the optimal harvest age changes with subsequent rotations due\nto the changing carbon price. The first-order optimality conditions therefore\nalso involve an infinite chain of lengths for consecutive forest rotations, and\nallow the approximation of the infinite-time problem with a truncated series of\nforest rotations.\n  Illustrative numerical calculations show that when starting from bare land,\nthe initial carbon price and its growth rate both primarily increase the length\nof the first rotation. With some combinations of the carbon pricing parameters,\nthe optimal harvest age can be several hundred years if the forest carbon is\nreleased to the atmosphere upon harvest. This effect is not, however, entirely\nmonotonous. Consequently, the currently optimal harvest ages are generally\nlower with higher rates of carbon price increase. This creates an interesting\ntemporal aspect, suggesting that the supply of wood and carbon sequestration by\nforests can change considerably during subsequent rotations under an increasing\nprice on carbon.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Tommi Ekholm</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1016/j.forpol.2015.10.007</arxiv:doi>\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2015.10.007\" rel=\"related\"/>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">in Forest Policy and Economics, 2015</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05669v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05669v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00146v2</id>\n    <updated>2017-07-11T23:46:56Z</updated>\n    <published>2015-05-30T17:57:22Z</published>\n    <title>The Theory of a Heliospheric Economy</title>\n    <summary>  Despite more than 50 years of human space exploration, no paper in the field\nof economics has been published regarding the theory of a space-based economy.\nThe aim of this paper is to develop quantitative techniques to estimate\nconditions of the human heliospheric expansion.

We have found that the form of\nthese distributions is not unique but heavily depends on the level of\ndevelopment of the nation, as expressed by macroeconomic indicators like GDP,\nGDP per capita, total export and a recently introduced measure for countries'\neconomic complexity called fitness. We have identified three major classes: a)\nan incomplete log-normal shape, truncated on the left side, for the less\ndeveloped countries, b) a complete log-normal, with a wider range of volumes,\nfor nations characterized by intermediate economy, and c) a strongly asymmetric\nshape for countries with a high degree of development. The ranking curves of\nthe exported volumes from each country seldom cross each other, showing a clear\nhierarchy of export volumes. Finally, the log-normality hypothesis has been\nchecked for the distributions of all the 148 countries through different tests,\nKolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramer-Von Mises, confirming that it cannot be rejected\nonly for the countries of intermediate economy.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Mario Alberto Annunziata</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Alberto Petri</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Giorgio Pontuale</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Andrea Zaccaria</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1140/epjst/e2015-50320-7</arxiv:doi>\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjst/e2015-50320-7\" rel=\"related\"/>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IWcee15 conference</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03597v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03597v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06069v2</id>\n    <updated>2016-06-01T15:54:13Z</updated>\n    <published>2015-06-18T07:44:52Z</published>\n    <title>Resolute refinements of social choice correspondences</title>\n    <summary>  Many classical social choice correspondences are resolute only in the case of\ntwo alternatives and an odd number of individuals.

We introduce a method for issuing,\nand redeeming a digital coin using a mechanism to create a sustainable global\neconomy and a free market. To maintain a currency's value over time, and\ntherefore be money proper, we claim it must be issued by the buyer and backed\nfor value by the seller, exchanging the products of labour, in a free market.\nWe also claim that a free market and sustainable economy cannot be maintained\nusing economically arbitrary creation and allocation of money. Nakamoto, with\nBitcoin, introduced a new technology called the cryptographic blockchain to\noperate a decentralised and distributed accounts ledger without the need for an\nuntrusted third party. This blockchain technology creates and allocates new\ndigital currency as a reward for \"proof-of-work\", to secure the network.\nHowever, no currency, digital or otherwise, has solved how to create and\nallocate money in an economically non-arbitrary way, or how to govern and trust\na world-scale free enterprise money system. We propose an \"Ontologically\nNetworked Exchange\" (ONE), with purpose as its highest order domain. Each\npurpose is defined in a contract, and the entire economy of contracts is\nstructured in a unified ontology. We claim to secure the ONE network using\neconomically non-arbitrary methodologies and economically incented human\nbehaviour. Decisions influenced by reputation help to secure the network\nwithout an untrusted third party. The stack of contracts, organised in a\nunified ontology, functions as a super recursive algorithm, with individual use\nprogramming the algorithm, acting as the \"oracle\".

This new approach is based on the\nidea that the price dispersion has its origin in the dynamics of the purchase\nprocess. The price dispersion is determined by the chance that demanded and\nsupplied product units meet in a given price interval. It can be characterized\nby a fat-tailed Laplace distribution for short and by a lognormal distribution\nfor long time horizons. Taking random temporal variations of demanded and\nsupplied units into account both the mean price and also the standard deviation\nof the price dispersion are governed by a lognormal distribution.

The recent Economic Complexity approach aims to quantify\nthe competitiveness of countries and the quality of the exported products based\non the empirical observation that the most competitive countries have\ndiversified exports, whereas developing countries only export few low quality\nproducts -- typically those exported by many other countries. Two different\nmetrics, Fitness-Complexity and the Method of Reflections, have been proposed\nto measure country and product score in the Economic Complexity framework. We\nuse international trade data and a recent ranking evaluation measure to\nquantitatively compare the ability of the two metrics to rank countries and\nproducts according to their importance in the network. The results show that\nthe Fitness-Complexity metric outperforms the Method of Reflections in both the\nranking of products and the ranking of countries. We also investigate a\nGeneralization of the Fitness-Complexity metric and show that it can produce\nimproved rankings provided that the input data are reliable.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Manuel Sebastian Mariani</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Alexandre Vidmer</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Matus Medo</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Yi-Cheng Zhang</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1140/epjb/e2015-60298-7</arxiv:doi>\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjb/e2015-60298-7\" rel=\"related\"/>\n    <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">The European Physical Journal B 88 (11), 1-9 (2015)</arxiv:journal_ref>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01482v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01482v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01484v1</id>\n    <updated>2015-05-28T20:55:29Z</updated>\n    <published>2015-05-28T20:55:29Z</published>\n    <title>Interdisciplinary Business Games on Sustainable Development: Theoretical\n  Foundations and Prospects of Implementation</title>\n    <summary>  The article defines the place of business games among all games in general\nbased on the classification by F.G.

In a famous discussion, Albert Hirschman\ncelebrated the Hiding Hand, which he saw as a benevolent mechanism by which\nunrealistically optimistic planners embark on unexpectedly challenging plans,\nonly to be rescued by human ingenuity, which they could not anticipate, but\nwhich ultimately led to success, principally in the form of unexpectedly high\nnet benefits. Studying eleven projects, Hirschman suggested that the Hiding\nHand is a general phenomenon. But the Benevolent Hiding Hand has an evil twin,\nthe Malevolent Hiding Hand, which blinds excessively optimistic planners not\nonly to unexpectedly high costs but also to unexpectedly low net benefits.\nStudying a much larger sample than Hirschman did, we find that the Malevolent\nHiding Hand is common and that the phenomenon that Hirschman identified is\nrare. This sobering finding suggests that Hirschman's phenomenon is a special\ncase; it attests to the pervasiveness of the planning fallacy, writ very large.\nOne implication involves the continuing need for unbiased cost-benefit analyses\nand other economic decision support tools; another is that such tools might\nsometimes prove unreliable.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Bent Flyvbjerg</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Cass R.

As I show, players playing a universalized prisoner's dilemma\nget as far out of the dilemma as is mathematically possible.

By applying this new cost function to a firm's decisional problem we\nfind that investing in Corporate Social Responsibility activities is ever\nconvenient depending on the number of sectors, the stakeholders' sensitivity to\nthese investments and the decay rate to alienation.

The wider effects and implications of\nwind generation is of direct relevance and importance to policy makers, as well\nas the grid operator and market traders. We compare electricity generation from\nCoal, Gas and wind, on both the wholesale and imbalance market. We calculate\nthe system cost of wind generation (government subsidies and curtailment costs)\nand the total energy costs. For the first time in the UK, we calculate the\nMerit Order Effect on spot price due to the wind component and show a $1.67\\%$\nprice decrease for every percentage point of wind generation (compared to the\n``zero-wind'' price). The net result of total costs and price savings is\nroughly zero (slight positive gain). We also consider the effect of not having\neither an onshore or an offshore wind component. We show that the Merit-Order\nEffect savings are heavily reduced, leading to an outgoing cost of wind\ngeneration in both cases. It is therefore important to have a significant total\npercentage of wind generation, from both onshore and offshore farms.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Lisa MH Hall</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Alastair Buckley</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Jose Mawyin</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">7 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05854v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.05854v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.EC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n</feed>\n"
