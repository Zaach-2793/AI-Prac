Software engineers, in particular,\nare trained to seek general solutions to problems. General solutions can be\nused not only to address the problem at hand, but also to address a wide range\nof problems that the designers may not have even anticipated. Sometimes\ndesigners wish to provide general solutions, while encouraging certain uses of\ntheir technology and discouraging or precluding others. They may attempt to\ninfluence the use of technology by ``hard-wiring'' it so that it only can be\nused in certain ways, licensing it so that those who use it are legally\nobligated to use it in certain ways, issuing guidelines for how it should be\nused, or providing resources that make it easier to use the technology as the\ndesigners intended than to use it in any other way.\n  This paper examines several cases where designers have attempted to influence\nthe use of technology through one of these mechanisms. Such cases include key\nrecovery encryption, Pegasus Mail, Platform for Internet Content Selection\n(PICS) Guidelines, Java, Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P)\nImplementation Guide, Apple's style guidelines, and Microsoft Foundation\nClasses. In some of these cases, the designers sought to influence the use of\ntechnology for competitive reasons or in order to promote standardization or\ninteroperability. However, in other cases designers were motivated by\npolicy-related goals such as protecting privacy or free speech. As new\ntechnologies are introduced with the express purpose of advancing\npolicy-related goals (for example, PICS and P3P), it is especially important to\nunderstand the roles designers might play in influencing the use of technology.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Lorrie Faith Cranor</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Rebecca N.

After analytically establishing the fact that the\nNet can be viewed as a pan-societal superstructure which supports its own\ndistinct culture, an ethnographic analysis is provided to find out the key\naspects of this culture. The elements of this culture which have an empowering\nimpacts on the standard mainstream societies, as well as the elements in it\nwhich can cause discouraging social effects are then discussed by a global\ninvestigation of the present status of various fundamental aspects (e,g,\neducation, economics, politics, entertainment etc) of the mainstream societies\nas well as their links with the Net culture. Though immensely potential for\nproviding various prominent positive impacts, the key findings of this work\nindicate that misuse of Internet can create tremendous harm to the members of\nthe mainstream societies by generating a set of morally crippled people as well\nas a future generation completely void of principles and ethics.

However, these shifts are uneven, both\nwith respect to field and with respect to the form of communication. Different\nscientific fields have developed and use distinctly different communicative\nforums, both in the paper and electronic arenas, and these forums play\ndifferent communicative roles within the field. One common claim is that we are\nin the early stages of an electronic revolution, that it is only a matter of\ntime before other fields catch up with the early adopters, and that all fields\nconverge on a stable set of electronic forums. A social shaping of technology\n(SST) perspective helps us to identify important social forces centered around\ndisciplinary constructions of trust and of legitimate communication that pull\nagainst convergence. This analysis concludes that communicative plurality and\ncommunicative heterogeneity are durable features of the scholarly landscape,\nand that we are likely to see field differences in the use of and meaning\nascribed to communications forums persist, even as overall use of electronic\ncommunications technologies both in science and in society as a whole\nincreases.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Rob Kling</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Geoffrey McKim</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Society for\n  Information Science.

These tools perform many\ndifferent functions in-cluding encrypting and/or anonymizing communications,\npreventing the use of persistent identifiers such as cookies, automatically\nfetching and analyzing web site privacy policies, and displaying\nprivacy-related information to users. This paper discusses the set of privacy\ntools that aim specifically at facilitating notice and choice about Web site\ndata practices. While these tools may also have components that perform other\nfunctions such as encryption, or they may be able to work in conjunction with\nother privacy tools, the primary pur-pose of these tools is to help make users\naware of web site privacy practices and to make it easier for users to make\ninformed choices about when to provide data to web sites.

US\nantitrust policy presumes that mergers reduce the amount and diversity of\ncontent available to consumers. However, the effects of consolidation in\ndifferentiated product markets cannot be determined solely from theory. Because\nmulti-product firms internalize business stealing, mergers may encourage firms\nto reposition products, leading to more, not less, variety. Using data on\nreporter assignments from 1993-1999, results show that differentiation and\nvariety increase with concentration. Moreover, there is evidence that\nadditional variety increases readership, suggesting that concentration benefits\nconsumers.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Lisa M.

In the\ncenter of this controversy are metasites, websites that display prices for a\nvariety of vendors. Metasites function by implementing shopbots, which extract\npricing data from other vendors' websites. Technological mechanisms have proved\nunsuccessful in blocking shopbots, and in response, websites have asserted a\nvariety of legal claims. Two recent cases, which rely on the troublesome\ntrespass to chattels doctrine, suggest that contract law may provide a less\ndemanding legal method of preventing the search of websites by data robots. If\nblocking collection of pricing data is as simple as posting an online contract,\nthe question arises whether this end result is desirable and legally viable.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Jeffrey M.

However, the results of research reported\nin this paper imply that voice traffic greatly exceeds data traffic when real\nusers are asked to estimate their usage of a wide variety of media. Media usage\nwas surveyed for students in New York City and in Los Angeles. Other than\nsignificant differences in radio listening, e-mails, and downloads, the usage\nwas quite similar. Telephone usage (wired and wireless) was nearly an hour per\nday. When converted to bits, the telephone traffic was much greater than the\ndata traffic over the Internet. This paper reports on the details of the two\nuser studies. The traffic implications of the results are estimated. The\nfinding that voice exceeds data will then be reconciled with the popular\nopposite conception.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>A.

This outcome will prevail even though there are\nmore native Chinese and Spanish speakers than there are native English\nspeakers. (B) As the Internet matures, it will more accurately reflect the\nnative languages spoken around the world (perhaps weighted by purchasing power)\nand will not promote English as a global language.\n  English's \"early lead\" on the web is more likely to persist if those who are\nnot native English speakers frequently access the large number of English\nlanguage web sites that are currently available. In that case, many existing\nweb sites will have little incentive to develop non-English versions of their\nsites, and new sites will tend to gravitate towards English. The key empirical\nquestion, therefore, is whether individuals whose native language is not\nEnglish use the Web, or certain types of Web sites, less than do native English\nspeakers. In order to examine this issue empirically, we employ a unique data\nset on Internet use at the individual level in Canada from Media Metrix. Canada\nprovides an ideal setting to examine this issue because English is one of the\ntwo official languages.\n  Our preliminary results suggest that English web sites are not a barrier to\nInternet use for French-speaking Quebecois. These preliminary results are\nconsistent with the scenario in which the Internet will promote English as a\nglobal language.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Neil Gandal</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Carl Shapiro</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29th TPRC Conference, 2001</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109009v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109009v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"K.4.m Miscellaneous\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109012v1</id>\n    <updated>2001-09-11T03:22:25Z</updated>\n    <published>2001-09-11T03:22:25Z</published>\n    <title>Is There a There There: Towards Greater Certainty for Internet\n  Jurisdiction</title>\n    <summary>  The unique challenge presented by the Internet is that compliance with local\nlaws is rarely sufficient to assure a business that it has limited its exposure\nto legal risk. The paper identifies why the challenge of adequately accounting\nfor the legal risk arising from Internet jurisdiction has been aggravated in\nrecent years by the adoption of the Zippo legal framework, commonly referred to\nas the passive versus active test. The test provides parties with only limited\nguidance and often results in detrimental judicial decisions from a policy\nperspective. Given the inadequacies of the Zippo passive versus active test,\nthe paper argues that it is now fitting to identify a more effective standard\nfor determining when it is appropriate to assert jurisdiction in cases\ninvolving predominantly Internet-based contacts. The solution submitted in the\npaper is to move toward a targeting-based analysis. Unlike the Zippo approach,\na targeting analysis would seek to identify the intentions of the parties and\nto assess the steps taken to either enter or avoid a particular jurisdiction.\nTargeting would also lessen the reliance on effects-based analysis, the source\nof considerable uncertainty since Internet-based activity can ordinarily be\nsaid to create some effects in most jurisdictions. To identify the appropriate\ncriteria for a targeting test, the paper recommends returning to the core\njurisdictional principle -- foreseeability. Foreseeability in the targeting\ncontext depends on three factors -- contracts, technology, and actual or\nimplied knowledge.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Michael Geist</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29th TPRC Conference, 2001</arxiv:comment>\n    <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">16 (3) Berkeley Tech.

Terrestrial Uses and\n  Users</title>\n    <summary>  As far as many consumers and businessmen and women are concerned,\nincreasingly wireline and wireless services, including those provided by\nterrestrial and satellite systems, are considered to be substitutes and\nsometimes complements, regardless of the laws and regulations applicable to\nthem. At the same time, many writers and even government agencies (such as the\nFCC) have suggested that users of the spectrum should be given more\nproperty-like rights in the use of the spectrum and at a minimum should be\ngiven much more flexibility in how they may use the spectrum. Two recent\ndevelopments have important implications with respect to \"convergence,\"\nspectrum property rights and flexible use of the spectrum. The first\ndevelopment involves several proposals to provide terrestrial wireless services\nwithin spectrum in use or planned to be used to provide satellite services. The\nsecond development is the passage of the 2000 ORBIT Act which specifically\nforbids the use of license auctions to select among mutually exclusive\napplicants to provide international or global satellite communications service.\nThe purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the questions raised by these\ntwo events, but not necessarily to provide definitive answers or solutions.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Douglas W.

The root of the domain\nname system is the top of the hierarchy and is currently managed by a\nquasi-private centralized regulatory authority, the Internet Corporation for\nAssigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This paper identifies and discusses the\neconomic and policy issues raised by competing DNS roots. The paper provides a\nprecise definition of root-competition and shows that multiple roots are a\nspecies of standards competition, in which network externalities play a major\nrole. The paper performs a structural analysis of the different forms that\ncompeting DNS roots can take and their effects on end-user compatibility. It\nthen explores the policy implications of the various forms of competition.\n  The thesis of the paper is that root competition is caused by a severe\ndisjunction between the demand for and supply of top-level domain names. ICANN\nhas authorized a tiny number of new top-level domains (7) and subjected their\noperators to excruciatingly slow and expensive contractual negotiations. The\ngrowth of alternate DNS roots is an attempt to bypass that bottleneck. The\npaper arrives at the policy conclusion that competition among DNS roots should\nbe permitted and is a healthy outlet for inefficiency or abuses of power by the\ndominant root administrator.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Milton L.

It aims to illustrate\nexplain and explore the implications of the movement of regulatory sovereignty\naway from the nation-state, through regional conduits, to global organisations\nin the crystallisation of a world system of telecommunications governance.\n  Our central argument is that telecommunications governance has evolved from a\nregulatory arena characterised, in large part, by national diversity, to one\nwherein a more convergent global multilayered system is emerging. We suggest\nthat the epicentre of this regulatory system is the relatively new World Trade\nOrganisation (WTO). Working in concert with the WTO are existing\nwell-established nodes regulation. In further complement, we see regional\nregulatory projects, notably the European Union (EU), as important conduits and\nnodes of regulation in the consolidation of a global regulatory regime.\n  By way of procedure, we first explore the utility of a neo-Gramscian approach\nfor understanding the development of global regulatory frameworks. Second, we\nsurvey something of the recent history - and, in extension, conventional wisdom\n- of telecommunications regulation at national and regional levels. Third, we\ndemonstrate how a multilayered system of global telecommunications regulation\nhas emerged centred around the regulatory authority of the WTO.

Telephone\ncompany executives (Bell Heads) may resent regulation, but they accept their\nfate and work creatively to exploit anomalies and opportunities to secure a\nregulation-conferred competitive advantage. Most ISP executives (Net Heads)\nappear to embrace a libertarian attitude, strongly opposing any government\ninvolvement. Despite the clash of cultures, the telecommunications and Internet\nworlds have merged. Such convergence jeopardizes the ability of Net Heads to\navoid some degree of regulation, particularly when they offer services\nfunctionally equivalent to what their Bell Head counterparts offer.\n  This paper will assess the regulatory consequences when telecommunication and\nInternet services converge in the marketplace and in terms of operating\ntechnologies. The paper identifies commercial developments in the Internet to\nsupport the view that the Internet has become more hierarchical and more like\ntelecommunication networks. The paper concludes that telecommunication carriers\nwill display superior skill in working the regulatory process to their\nadvantage. The paper suggests that Bell Heads will outmaneuver Net Heads\nparticularly when the revenue siphoning effect of Internet-mediated services\noffsets the revenues generated from ISP leases of telecommunication\ntransmission capacity.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Rob Frieden</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109035v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109035v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"K.4.m Miscellaneous\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109036v2</id>\n    <updated>2001-10-17T12:12:07Z</updated>\n    <published>2001-09-19T18:42:27Z</published>\n    <title>Competition and Price Dispersion in International Long Distance Calling</title>\n    <summary>  This paper examines the relationship between changes in telecommunications\nprovider concentration on international long distance routes and changes in\nprices on those routes. Overall, decreased concentration is associated with\nsignificantly lower prices to consumers of long distance services. However, the\nrelationship between concentration and price varies according to the type of\nlong distance plan considered. For the international flagship plans frequently\nselected by more price-conscious consumers of international long distance,\nincreased competition on a route is associated with lower prices. In contrast,\nfor the basic international plans that are the default selection for consumers,\nincreased competition on a route is actually associated with higher prices.\nThus, somewhat surprisingly, price dispersion appears to increase as\ncompetition increases.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Sean F.

The industry cannot adopt the standard without the\npermission of the intellectual property owner (or owners).\n  How SSOs respond to those who assert intellectual property rights is\ncritically important. Whether or not private companies retain intellectual\nproperty rights in group standards will determine whether a standard is \"open\"\nor \"closed.\" It will determine who can sell compliant products, and it may well\ninfluence whether the standard adopted in the market is one chosen by a group\nor one offered by a single company. SSO rules governing intellectual property\nrights will also affect how standards change as technology improves.\n  Given the importance of SSO rules governing intellectual property rights,\nthere has been surprisingly little treatment of SSOs or their intellectual\nproperty rules in the legal literature. My aim in this article is to fill that\nvoid. To do so, I have surveyed the intellectual property policies of dozens of\nSSOs, primarily but not exclusively in the computer networking and\ntelecommunications industries.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Mark A.

As expected,\nretrenchment from low residential retail rates - the most universalistic\nbenefit for customers - faces the greatest political resistance.

The divestiture\nfractured this monolithic system as it forced the PUCs to respond to new forces\nunleashed in their own backyards. Soon there was great diversity in the overall\nregulatory landscape. Within this new environment, there is considerable\ndisparity among the PUCs in terms of their ability to implement new ideas. This\npaper seeks to understand the structural factors that influence the latitude of\nregulatory action by PUCs via a comparative study of local telephone\ncompetition policy making in Arkansas and New York.

As Internet\nradio usage has increased certain stakeholders have begun to argue that these\nInternet radio broadcasters are providing significant and diverse programming\nto American audiences and that government regulation of spectrum-using radio\nstation ownership may be further relaxed.\n  One of the primary justifications for regulation of ownership has been to\nprotect diversity in broadcasting. This study hypothesizes that Internet radio\nbroadcasting does add diversity to the radio broadcasting industry and that it\nshould be considered as relevant by regulators.\n  This study evaluates the role of Internet radio broadcasters according to\nfive criteria intended to gauge the level of diversity being delivered to\nlisteners online. By measuring the levels of format, channel, ownership,\nlocation and language diversity among Internet radio stations, it is possible\nto draw benchmark lessons about the new medium's ability to provide Americans\nwith diverse broadcasting options.\n  The study finds that Internet radio broadcasters are in fact adding\nmeasurable diversity to the radio broadcasting industry. Internet broadcasters\nare providing audiences with access to an increasing number of stations,\nowners, formats, and language choices, and it is likely that technologies\naiding in the mobility of access as well as broadband evolution will reinforce\nthese findings.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Benjamin Compaine</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Emma Smith</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29th TPRC Conference, 2001</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109046v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109046v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"K.4.m Miscellaneous\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109047v1</id>\n    <updated>2001-09-22T19:00:15Z</updated>\n    <published>2001-09-22T19:00:15Z</published>\n    <title>Between a rock and a hard place: assessing the application of domestic\n  policy and South Africa's commitments under the WTO'S Basic\n  Telecommunications Agreement</title>\n    <summary>  South Africa adopted the GATS Basic Agreement on Telecommunications and the\nregulatory principles in 1998.

It is argued that the dynamic\nproduced through this tension affords domestic governments a mechanism with\nwhich to balance the seemingly opposing goals of competition and development.\nIt is further argued that the broad regulatory principles, adopted by all\nsignatories and often criticized for lack of precision, facilitate this fine\nbalancing and affords domestic governments an opportunity to advance sovereign\nconcerns while pursuing international trade ideals.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Tracy Cohen</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29th TPRC Conference, 2001</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109047v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109047v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"K.4.m Miscellaneous\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109048v1</id>\n    <updated>2001-09-22T19:25:55Z</updated>\n    <published>2001-09-22T19:25:55Z</published>\n    <title>Competition and Commons: The Post-Telecom Act Public Interest, in and\n  after the AOLTW Merger</title>\n    <summary>  In asserting a competitive market environment as a justification for\nregulatory forbearance, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 finally articulated\na clear standard for the FCC's public interest standard, one of the most\nprotean concepts in communications. This seeming clarity has not, however,\ninhibited intense political conflict over the term. This paper examines public\nand regulatory debate over the AOL Time Warner merger as an example of the way\nin which the linkage between competitions and commons policy becomes relevant\nto communications policy, particularly in relation to mass media, and discusses\ninterpretations of the public interest in the current FCC. The paper proposes\nthat the Telecom Act's goal of fostering economic competition among information\nservice providers, and the democratic ideal of nurturing public relationships\nand behaviors can be linked. Competition policy that creates the opportunity\nfor untrammeled interactivity also provides a sine qua non to nurture the\nsocial phenomenon of the commons. The linked concepts of competition and\ncommons could also provide useful ways to interpret the public interest in\npolicy arenas as spectrum allocation and intellectual property.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Patricia Aufderheide</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29th TPRC Conference, 2001</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109048v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109048v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"K.4.m Miscellaneous\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109049v1</id>\n    <updated>2001-09-22T22:57:01Z</updated>\n    <published>2001-09-22T22:57:01Z</published>\n    <title>Signing Initiative Petitions Online: Possibilities, Problems and\n  Prospects</title>\n    <summary>  Many people expect the Internet to change American politics, most likely in\nthe direction of increasing direct citizen participation and forcing government\nofficials to respond more quickly to voter concerns. A recent California\ninitiative with these objectives would authorize use of encrypted digital\nsignatures over the Internet to qualify candidates, initiatives, and other\nballot measures. Proponents of Internet signature gathering say it will\nsignificantly lower the cost of qualifying initiatives and thereby reduce the\ninfluence of organized, well-financed interest groups. They also believe it\nwill increase both public participation in the political process and public\nunderstanding about specific measures. However, opponents question whether\nInternet security is adequate to prevent widespread abuse and argue that the\nmeasure would create disadvantages for those who lack access to the Internet.\nBeyond issues of security, cost, and access lie larger questions about the\neffects of Internet signature gathering on direct democracy. Would it encourage\ngreater and more informed public participation in the political process? Or\nwould it flood voters with ballot measures and generally worsen current\nproblems with the initiative process itself? Because we lack good data on these\nquestions, answers to them today are largely conjectural. We can be fairly\nsure, however, that Internet petition signing, like Internet voting, will have\nunintended consequences.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Walter S.

In a multi-operator context, this is usually operationalized\nthrough Universal Service Obligations (USO), by which various operators are\nmandated to provide a part of their services to rural areas or to high cost to\nserve customers at \"affordable\" prices.\n  This paper highlights the various issues in USO from a developing country\nperspective. The first part of this paper gives an overview of USO practices\nand issues. The second part reviews the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's\nrecommendations on USO cost estimation. In the third part, the paper analyzes\ncharacteristics of rural exchanges with a view to evolve a framework for\nassessing USO. This framework is applicable to developing countries as the\nstudy carried out in this paper is in the context of a developing country\ncharacterized by low telecom penetration and non-availability of data with\nregulators.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Rekha S.

I identify five economic characteristics of\nInternet technology that should lead to these greater efficiencies: (1) lower\ndelivery costs and reduced capacity constraints, (2) more efficient\ninteractivity, (3) more efficient advertising and sponsorship, (4) more\nefficient direct pricing and bundling, and (5) lower costs of copying and\nsharing.\n  The most successful Internet TV business models are likely to involve\nsyndication to or from other media, and also international distribution. In the\nbroader context, Internet TV is another syndication outlet by which program\nsuppliers can segment their overall markets and thus support higher production\ninvestments. Many innovative and more sharply focused programs will surely\nprosper on Internet TV, but the attractiveness to audiences of high production\nvalue programming will tend to advantage broad appeal programming, such as\nHollywood movies. Historical evidence about the performance of cable television\nand videocassettes is presented to support these points.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>David Waterman</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29th TPRC Conference, 2001</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109051v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109051v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"K.4.m Miscellaneous\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109052v1</id>\n    <updated>2001-09-24T01:39:18Z</updated>\n    <published>2001-09-24T01:39:18Z</published>\n    <title>Globalization and Governance in Cyberspace: Mapping the Processes of\n  Emergent Regime Formation in Global Information and Communications Policy</title>\n    <summary>  This paper develops a theoretical perspective on globalization and the\nInformation Society and combines it with a critical usage of international\nregime theory as a heuristic for understanding the current historical period of\ntransition from an international telecommunicaitons regime (Cowhey, 1990; 1994)\nto a new and complex regime aimed at providing governance for the Global\nInformation Infrastructure and Global Information Society (GII/GIS). In\nanalyzing the principles, values, norms, rules, collective decision-making\nprdocedures, and enforcement mechanisms of the emergent GII/GIS regime, this\npaper differentiates between three regime levels: (1) Macro-Regime--global; (2)\nMezzo-Regime--regional and sub-regional; and (3) Micro-Regime--national. The\npaper employs a case-study approach to explore some of the specific national\nresponses (i.e. South Africa) to this regime transition, with an analysis of\npotential best practices and lessons learned for other emerging economies. Key\nfindings in this paper are: (1) that a range of social, political, economic,\nand technological factors are eroding the existing international\ntelecommunications regime (e.g., VOIP;, call-back, VSATs, accounting rate\nrestructuring, pressure for applicaitons development, and SMMEs); (2) a new\nregime for global information and communicaitons policy is emerging, but is\nbeing driven not by the broad possibilities of the Information Society, but by\nthe more specific interests of global and multi-national corporations related\nto global e-commerce; (3) numerous strategic responses have been developed at\nnational, subregional, and regional levels to the challenges of this transition\nin both developed and developing regions; and (4) without a collaborative\nresponse, the developing world will be further marginalized by this new regime.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Derrick L.

E-commerce dramatically increases the potential for marketers to\naccumulate otherwise private information about potential customers. Online\nmarketers claim that this information enables them to better market their\nproducts. Policy makers are currently drafting rules to regulate the way in\nwhich these marketers can collect, store, and share this information. However,\nthere is little evidence yet either of consumers' valuation of their privacy or\nof the benefits they might reap through better target marketing. We provide a\nframework for measuring a portion of the benefits from allowing marketers to\nmake better use of consumer information. Target marketing is likely to reduce\nconsumer search costs, improve consumer product selection decisions, and lower\nthe marketing costs of goods sold. Our model allows us to estimate the value to\nconsumers of only the latter, price reductions from more efficient marketing.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Michael R.

Using standard economic\nindicators (CR4=58% and HHI=1163), the industry looks close to being plagued by\nanticompetitive practices. But based on a network adjusted HHI constructed in\nthis paper, its value, 870, suggests that there is less cause for concern.\n  Based on all indicators, it suggests that Yahoo would be a contender. Other\npossible contenders are MSN and Netscape. On the basis of results to date, some\nsearch engines keep increasing their audience reach while others don't. The\ntrend shows that some search engines may dominate the search engine market. We\nsuggest conducting research in the coverage performance of search engines and\ninvestigate \"information search cost\" as a performance indicator of search\ntechniques. In addition, we suggest paying attention to any anticompetitive\nconduct (e.g. product bundling) that may lesson competition and reduce consumer\nwelfare. The combination of network theory and economic theory to study the\nsearch engine market is a particularly powerful approach for E-Commerce.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Tair-Rong Sheu</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Kathleen Carley</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29th TPRC Conference, 2001</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109054v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109054v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"K.4.m Miscellaneous\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109055v1</id>\n    <updated>2001-09-24T04:57:52Z</updated>\n    <published>2001-09-24T04:57:52Z</published>\n    <title>Standardization versus Coverage in Wireless Telephone Networks</title>\n    <summary>  The issue of market-based versus mandated standards has been addressed in\nmany settings.

This historical case study of the period between Sputnik and the\ncreation of the ARPANET shows how military, scientific, and academic values\nshaped the institutions and relations of a foundational period in the creation\nof the Internet.\n  The paper probes three areas: the ideology of the science policy consensus,\nthe institutional philosophy of IPTO under J. C. R. Licklider, and the ways\nthat this consensus and philosophy shaped IPTO research in the period leading\nto the creation of the ARPANET. By examining the intellectual, cultural, and\ninstitutional details of the consensus that governed IPTO research between 1957\nand 1969, we can understand the ways that these values defined the range of\npossibilities for network computing.\n  The influence of the social values expressed by these actors was decisive:\nthat government had an obligation to support a broad base of scientific\nresearch to promote both the public good and the national defense; that\nIPTO-sponsored computing research would accomplish both military and scientific\nobjectives; and that IPTO could leverage its power within this consensus to\ncreate a network to share resources and unite researchers over geographical\ndistance.

Theoretically, the answer\ncould be either \"yes\" or \"no,\" due to two opposing incentives in firms' pricing\ndecisions. The firm would like to charge a higher price to previous purchasers\nwho are \"locked-in\" and a lower price to unattached consumers who offer higher\nfuture profitability. I demonstrate this ambiguity in an infinite-horizon\ntheoretical model.\n  800- (toll-free) number portability provides empirical evidence to answer\nthis question. Before portability, a customer had to change numbers to change\nservice providers. This imposed significant switching costs on users, who\ngenerally invested heavily to publicize these numbers. In May 1993 a new\ndatabase made 800-numbers portable. This drop in switching costs and\nregulations that precluded price discrimination between old and new consumers\nprovide an empirical test of switching costs' effect on price competition.\n  I use contracts for virtual private network (VPN) services to test how AT&amp;T\nadjusted its prices for toll-free services in response to portability.\nPreliminarily (awaiting completion of data collection), I find that AT&amp;T\nreduced margins for VPN contracts containing toll-free services relative to\nthose that did not as the portability date approached. This implies that the\nswitching costs due to non-portability made the market less competitive. These\nresults suggest that, despite toll-free services growing rapidly during this\ntime period, AT&amp;T's incentive to charge a higher price to \"locked-in\" consumers\nexceeded its incentive to capture new consumers in the high switching costs era\nof non-portability.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>V.

Yet the tremendous benefits of the Internet are not shared\nequally by all. One way to close the gap of the \"digital divide\" is to ensure\nInternet access to all schools from an early age. While both the USA and EU\nhave embraced the promotion of Internet access to schools, the two have decided\nto finance it differently. This paper shows that the main costs of Internet\naccess to schools are not communications-related (telecommunications and\nInternet services) but rather non-communications-related (hardware, educational\ntraining, software). This paper goes on to discuss whether the identified costs\nshould be financed in any way by the universal service obligations funded by\nthe telecommunications industry/sector/consumers (sector specific) or a general\ngovernmental budget (educational budget).\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Michelle S.

That is, the Internet may level\nthe consumption playing field between large, variety-laden and small,\nvariety-starved markets. However, if local content on the Internet is more\nprevalent in larger markets, then the Internet may be a complement for urban\nagglomeration. Characterizing the nature of available content using Media\nMetrix web page visits by about 13,500 households, we document that\nsubstantially more online local content is available in larger markets.\nCombining this with CPS Internet use data, we find statistically significant\ndirect evidence of both complementarity and substitutability: Individuals are\nmore likely to connect in markets with more local online content; and holding\nlocal online content constant, are less likely to connect in larger markets. We\nalso find that individuals connect to overcome local isolation: Blacks are more\nlikely to connect, relative to whites, when they comprise a smaller fraction of\nlocal population, making the Internet is a substitute for agglomeration of\npreference minorities within cities, if not cities themselves. On balance we\nfind that the substitution and complementarity effects offset each other so\nthat the Internet does not promote or discourage agglomeration in larger\nmarkets.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Todd Sinai</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Joel Waldfogel</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29th TPTC Conference, 2001</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109061v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109061v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"K.4.m Miscellaneous\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109062v1</id>\n    <updated>2001-09-24T14:20:39Z</updated>\n    <published>2001-09-24T14:20:39Z</published>\n    <title>India Attempts to Give a Jump-start to its Derailed Telecommunications\n  Liberalization Process</title>\n    <summary>  After the 1991 economic policy made a shift from a closed economic model to a\nmarket-oriented model.

Neither the USA or Europe has made a very good job of\ndevising a clean framework and the WTO agreement is sparing in this area. A\nnumber of pressures in the European context have enabled a more systematic\napproach to emerge, that exploits the academic work. They include the need for\nthe European regulatory framework to encompass E. European countries where\nnetwork development and income levels are much lower, the desire to encompass\nInternet within the universal service regulatory framework, a willingness to\ndesign a framework that covers all communications networks and remove the\ntelecommunications bias, thereby forcing issues of economic neutrality to the\nfore. The paper systematically goes through a number of key areas and\nprinciples of regulation and how they are being designed to deal with a range\nof national situations. They include, defining the scope of universal service\nand the principles by which it might be modified in the light of technological\nand economic developments; incorporating latitude for intervention outside this\ndefined scope, defining incentive and designation methods to encourage the\nefficient supply of elements of universal service obligations, interpreting\naffordability in the context of price and income levels that diverge\nconsiderably, requiring both allocative efficiency and competitive neutrality,\nformulating alternative financing methods including general government\nfinancing and value added tax type methods which can co-exist and provide\ncomparative policy yardsticks.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Richard Cawley</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29th TPRC Conference, 2001</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109063v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109063v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"K.4.m Miscellaneous\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109064v1</id>\n    <updated>2001-09-24T15:28:07Z</updated>\n    <published>2001-09-24T15:28:07Z</published>\n    <title>Commonalities: The R.E.A. and High-Speed Rural Internet Access</title>\n    <summary>  This paper explores commonalities between the creation of the Rural\nElectrification Administration and the similar dilemma of providing an\naffordable infrastructure for high-speed Internet access in places where profit\nincentives do not exist. In the case of the R.E.A., the necessity for an\naggressive federal initiative to wire rural America, where the market for\nelectricity had failed, is revisited as the missing incentives are identified\nand explored. We then examine the incentive-poor similarities between rural\nelectrification and rural high-speed Internet access through how consumers\ncurrently and prospectively gain access to broadband Internet service. The\nregulatory environment created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the\nFederal Communications Commission is considered. Although the FCC is required\n(Section 254.b.3) to take regulatory measures to ensure comparable and\naffordable access to the Internet for all Americans, the historical\nsimilarities and comparative analysis of rural electrification and high-speed\nInternet access suggests the goal of universal service is unlikely to be met in\nthe near future. Regulatory disincentives to build such networks are present,\ndriven in part by market realities and in part by competitive restrictions in\nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996. Finally, we pose the question of whether a\nfederal effort equivalent to the R.E.A. is needed to ensure that residents of\nsparsely populated areas, like their predecessors in the 1930s, are not\ncomparatively disadvantaged in the first decades of the 21st century. The paper\nconcludes with a proposal to accelerate the deployment of broadband\ninfrastructure in rural America.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Laurence J.

Generally, they have been for abstract networks, have not\nbeen focused on the public switched telephone network, or they have not\nincluded the operating costs. This paper presents the operating cost portion of\nour ongoing research project comparing circuit-switched and IP network costs\nfor an existing local exchange carrier.\n  We have found that (1) The operating cost differential between IP and circuit\nswitching for this LEC will be small; and (2) A substantial majority of a\ntelco's operating cost lies in customer service and outside plant maintenance,\nwhich will be incurred equally in both networks in a pure substitution\nscenario. Thus, the operating cost difference lies in the actual cost\ndifferences of the switching technologies. This appears to be less than 10%-15%\nof the total operating cost of the network. Thus, even if the cost differences\nfor substitute services were large, the overall impact on the telco's financial\nperformance would be small. But IP has some hidden benefits on the operations\nside. Most notably, data and voice services could be managed with the same\nsystems infrastructure, meaning that the incremental operations cost of rolling\nout new services would likely be much lower, since it would all be IP.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Martin B.

As for SMEs, public intervention concerns\nboth the promotion of fully competitive e-markets and the solution of market\nfailures. However, effective and efficient intervention requires specific\ninformation on SMEs' approach to e-commerce, often depending upon specific\nsector and local condition and in most cases still lacking. In order to\nidentify the need and the scope for public intervention, the paper focuses on a\npeculiar SMEs-intensive productive environment: the manufacturing industrial\ndistrict, which traditionally constitutes an examples of winning SMEs' network,\ncharacterised by common industrial culture and intense input-output\ninteractions. The paper presents empirical evidence from the Italian districts\nof Como (textile industry) and Lumezzane (metalwork industry). The research\nresults show that pro-active entrepreneurs are creatively exploring the\nopportunities offered by the Internet to promote their businesses. However, it\nis also clear that the transition to the Internet economy still involves a\nreduced percentage of potential participants, and that institutional actions\nare needed in order to foster a larger participation.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Lucia Piscitello</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Francesca Sgobbi</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29th Research Conference on Communication, Information and Internet\n  Policy, October 27-29, 2001, Alexandria, Virginia Area: Economic Growth and\n  Development</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109073v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109073v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"A.0; J.4\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109074v3</id>\n    <updated>2001-10-22T20:19:22Z</updated>\n    <published>2001-09-24T18:54:27Z</published>\n    <title>Indicators of Independence in Regulatory Commissions</title>\n    <summary>  Independent regulatory commissions such as the Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) must produce policies that reflect technical expertise, legal\nprecedent, and stakeholder input.

Research such as this may be helpful\nin the creation of new, or for assessment of existing, regulatory commissions,\nbut only if great attention is paid not only to institutional structure, but\nalso to the practice of staff in the agency.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Susan Oberlander</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29th TPRC Conference, 2001 This revision has minor editorial changes</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109074v3\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109074v3\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"K.4.m Miscellaneous\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109075v1</id>\n    <updated>2001-09-24T19:25:48Z</updated>\n    <published>2001-09-24T19:25:48Z</published>\n    <title>ICANN and Antitrust</title>\n    <summary>  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a private\nnon-profit company which, pursuant to contracts with the US government, acts as\nthe de facto regulator for DNS policy. ICANN decides what TLDs will be made\navailable to users, and which registrars will be permitted to offer those TLDs\nfor sale. In this article we focus on a hitherto-neglected implication of\nICANN's assertion that it is a private rather than a public actor: its\npotential liability under the U.S. antitrust laws, and the liability of those\nwho transact with it. ICANN argues that it is not as closely tied to the\ngovernment as NSI and IANA were in the days before ICANN was created. If this\nis correct, it seems likely that ICANN will not benefit from the antitrust\nimmunity those actors enjoyed. Some of ICANN's regulatory actions may restrain\ncompetition, e.g. its requirement that applicants for new gTLDs demonstrate\nthat their proposals would not enable competitive (alternate) roots and ICANN's\npreventing certain types of non-price competition among registrars (requiring\nthe UDRP). ICANN's rule adoption process might be characterized as\nanticompetitive collusion by existing registrars, who are likely not be subject\nto the Noerr-Pennington lobbying exemption. Whether ICANN has in fact violated\nthe antitrust laws depends on whether it is an antitrust state actor, whether\nthe DNS is an essential facility, and on whether it can shelter under\nprecedents that protect standard-setting bodies. If (as seems likely) a private\nICANN and those who petition it are subject to antitrust law, everyone involved\nin the process needs to review their conduct with an eye towards legal\nliability. ICANN should act very differently with respect to both the UDRP and\nthe competitive roots if it is to avoid restraining trade.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>A.

The projects were funded under a state program to diffuse broadband\ntechnologies in economically depressed areas of the state. The networks are\ntechnologically complex and entail high costs for subscribers. The political\neconomy of the development process has biased the subscriber base toward the\nresource rich and away from the resource poor, and toward tried-and-tested uses\nlike Internet and intra-organizational connectivity and away from\ncommunity-oriented uses. These trends raise troubling questions about network\nontology and function, and about the relation between the network and its\nphysical host community. The need for appropriate social policy, and new\nplanning practices, is argued to effect desired change.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Murali Venkatesh</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Dong-Hee Shin</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">14 pages</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0109076v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109076v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"K.4.3\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n</feed>\n"
