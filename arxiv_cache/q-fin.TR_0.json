With the use of mean field theory\ntechniques, we derive equations for the flow of products in an economy driven\nby heterogeneous preferences and probabilistic interaction between agents. We\nare able to show that if the economic agents have static preferences, which are\nalso homogeneous in any of the steady states, the final wealth distribution is\nindependent of the dynamics of the non-equilibrium theory. In particular, it is\ncompletely determined in terms of the initial conditions, and it is independent\nof the probability, and the network of interaction between agents. We show that\nthe main effect of the network is to determine the relaxation time via the\nusual eigenvalue gap as in random walks on graphs.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Samuel E.

This suggests the\nuse of price thresholds to simulate agent behavior over much longer timescales\nthan are currently used in models of order-books.\n  We show that many phenomena, routinely ignored in efficient market theory,\ncan be systematically introduced into an otherwise efficient market, resulting\nin models that robustly replicate the most important stylized facts.\n  We then demonstrate a close link between such threshold models and queueing\ntheory, with large price changes corresponding to the busy periods of a\nsingle-server queue. The distribution of the busy periods is known to have\nexcess kurtosis and non-exponential decay under various assumptions on the\nqueue parameters. Such an approach may prove useful in the development of\nmathematical models for rapid deleveraging and panics in financial markets, and\nthe stress-testing of financial institutions.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>H.

The model induces a\nsimply-connected but possibly multi-component bipartite graph. A trading\nsession on a fixed graph consists of a sequence of exchanges between connected\nbuyers and sellers until no more exchanges are possible. We deem a trading\nsession \"feasible\" if all of the buyers satisfy their respective demands. If\nall trading sessions are feasible the graph is deemed \"successful\", otherwise\nthe feasibility of a trading session depends on the order of the sequence of\nexchanges. We demonstrate that topology is important for the success of trading\nsessions on graphs. In particular, for the case that supply equals demand for\neach component of the graph, we prove that the graph is successful if and only\nif the graph consists of components each of which are complete bipartite. For\nthe case that supply exceeds demand, we prove that the other topologies also\ncan be made successful but with finite reserve (i.e., excess supply)\nrequirements that may grow proportional to the number of buyers. Finally, with\ncomputations for a small instance of the model, we provide an example of the\nwide range of performance in which only the connectivity varies. These results\ntaken together place limits on the improvements in performance that can be\nexpected from proposals to increase the connectivity of sparse exchange\nnetworks.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Vitus J.

We address these large\ntrades as hidden orders. In order to identify and characterize hidden orders we\nfit hidden Markov models to the time series of the sign of the tick by tick\ninventory variation of market members of the Spanish Stock Exchange. Our\nmethodology probabilistically detects trading sequences, which are\ncharacterized by a net majority of buy or sell transactions. We interpret these\npatches of sequential buying or selling transactions as proxies of the traded\nhidden orders. We find that the time, volume and number of transactions size\ndistributions of these patches are fat tailed. Long patches are characterized\nby a high fraction of market orders and a low participation rate, while short\npatches have a large fraction of limit orders and a high participation rate. We\nobserve the existence of a buy-sell asymmetry in the number, average length,\naverage fraction of market orders and average participation rate of the\ndetected patches. The detected asymmetry is clearly depending on the local\nmarket trend. We also compare the hidden Markov models patches with those\nobtained with the segmentation method used in Vaglica {\\it et al.} (2008) and\nwe conclude that the former ones can be interpreted as a partition of the\nlatter ones.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Gabriella Vaglica</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Fabrizio Lillo</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Rosario N.

An inconsistency exists to some extent\nin the sense that the ``constant pricing rule \" actually assumes an adaptive\nexpected price with pricing rule given before insider making the decision, and\nthe ``market efficiency\" condition, however, assumes a rational expected price\nand implies that the pricing rule can be influenced by insider's strategy. We\nloosen the ``constant pricing rule \" assumption by taking into account\nsufficiently the insider's strategy has on pricing rule. According to the\ncharacteristic of the conditional expectation of the informed profits, three\ndifferent models vary with insider's attitudes regarding to risk are presented.\nCompared to Kyle (1985), the risk-averse insider in Model 1 can obtain larger\nguaranteed profits, the risk-neutral insider in Model 2 can obtain a larger ex\nante expectation of total profits across all periods and the risk-seeking\ninsider in Model 3 can obtain larger risky profits.

We show that there is an equilibrium in which the\nirrational insider camouflages his trades with a noise component so that his\nprivate information is revealed slowly and linearly whenever he is\noverconfident or underconfident. We also investigate the relationship between\nthe heterogeneous beliefs and the trade intensity in the presence of trade\ndisclosure, and show that the weights on asymmetric information and\nheterogeneous prior beliefs are opposite in sign and they change alternatively\nin the next period. Under the requirement of disclosure, the irrational insider\ntrades more aggressively and leads to smaller market depth. Moreover, the\nco-existence of \"public disclosure requirement\" and \"heterogeneous prior\nbeliefs\" leads to the fluctuant multi-period expected profits and a larger\ntotal expected trading volume which is positively related to the degree of\nheterogeneity. More importantly, even public disclosure may lead to negative\nprofits of the irrational insider's in some periods, inside trading remains\nprofitable from the whole trading period.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Fuzhou Gong</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Hong Liu</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">35 pages, 16 figures</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.2414v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.2414v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3115v5</id>\n    <updated>2012-08-03T15:52:43Z</updated>\n    <published>2011-05-16T15:05:54Z</published>\n    <title>Dealing with the Inventory Risk. A solution to the market making problem</title>\n    <summary>  Market makers continuously set bid and ask quotes for the stocks they have\nunder consideration. Hence they face a complex optimization problem in which\ntheir return, based on the bid-ask spread they quote and the frequency at which\nthey indeed provide liquidity, is challenged by the price risk they bear due to\ntheir inventory. In this paper, we consider a stochastic control problem\nsimilar to the one introduced by Ho and Stoll and formalized mathematically by\nAvellaneda and Stoikov. The market is modeled using a reference price $S_t$\nfollowing a Brownian motion with standard deviation $\\sigma$, arrival rates of\nbuy or sell liquidity-consuming orders depend on the distance to the reference\nprice $S_t$ and a market maker maximizes the expected utility of its P&amp;L over a\nfinite time horizon. We show that the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations\nassociated to the stochastic optimal control problem can be transformed into a\nsystem of linear ordinary differential equations and we solve the market making\nproblem under inventory constraints. We also shed light on the asymptotic\nbehavior of the optimal quotes and propose closed-form approximations based on\na spectral characterization of the optimal quotes.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Olivier Gu\u00e9ant</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Charles-Albert Lehalle</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Joaquin Fernandez Tapia</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1007/s11579-012-0087-0</arxiv:doi>\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11579-012-0087-0\" rel=\"related\"/>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3115v5\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.3115v5\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"49L99, 91G80, 93E20\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5439v1</id>\n    <updated>2011-05-27T01:43:19Z</updated>\n    <published>2011-05-27T01:43:19Z</published>\n    <title>Adding to the Regulator's Toolbox: Integration and Extension of Two\n  Leading Market Models</title>\n    <summary>  As demonstrated during the recent financial crisis, regulators require\nadditional analytical tools to assess systemic risk in the financial sector.\nThis paper describes one such tool; namely a novel market modeling and analysis\ncapability.

The presence\nof ties in the agents' best-response correspondences yields discontinuous\npayoff functions for the agencies. These discontinuities are dealt with via\nefficient tie--breaking rules. In a first step, the model presented by Carlier,\nEkeland &amp; Touzi (2007) of optimal derivative design by profit-maximizing\nagencies is extended to a multiple--firm setting, and results of Page &amp;\nMonteiro (2003, 2007, 2008) are used to prove the existence of\n(mixed-strategies) Nash equilibria. On a second step we consider the more\ncomplex case of risk minimizing firms. Here the concept of socially efficient\nallocations is introduced, and existence of the latter is proved. It is also\nshown that in the particular case of the entropic risk measure, there exists an\nefficient \"fix--mix\" tie-breaking rule, in which case firms share the whole\nmarket over given proportions.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Ulrich Horst</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Santiago Moreno-Bromberg</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">34 pages and 6 figures</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0839v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.0839v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"91B26, 91B30, 91B69\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3133v1</id>\n    <updated>2011-10-14T07:44:20Z</updated>\n    <published>2011-10-14T07:44:20Z</published>\n    <title>Price impact asymmetry of institutional trading in Chinese stock market</title>\n    <summary>  The asymmetric price impact between the institutional purchases and sales of\n32 liquid stocks in Chinese stock markets in year 2003 is carefully studied.

Strongly asymmetric\ncross-correlation functions are empirically observed, especially in the\nfuture/stock case. We confirm the intuition that the most liquid assets (short\nintertrade duration, narrow bid/ask spread, small volatility, high turnover)\ntend to lead smaller stocks. However, the most correlated stocks are those with\nsimilar levels of liquidity. This lead/lag phenomenon is not constant\nthroughout the day, it shows an intraday seasonality with changes of behaviour\nat very specific times such as the announcement of macroeconomic figures and\nthe US market opening. These lead/lag relationships become more and more\npronounced as we zoom on significant events.

The purpose is to understand the interactions of the\ndifferent aspects within a 'semi-closed' system. The complexity and nature of\nthe system led to the process of modifying the pricing mechanism which is\nviewed from a different angle to the classical Brownian Motion and the Random\nWalk model. However, it incorporates the essence of these two fundamental\ntheories and then investigates the matrix of investors' behaviours in relation\nto news feedbacks. This paper also explores the realm of randomly generated\nnews to the responses of participants to determine rational and irrational\nbehaviours. This is carried out through uncompressing the time within the\nexperiment and looking at concordant and disconcordant behaviour. The focus is\non how the modified pricing equation adapts to the conditions and uniqueness\nsurrounding a semi-closed stock market. Thus, this paper looks at how a simple\nmarket system where the main determinants of share prices are news, demand and\nsupply along with some filtering of the external forces can affect the\nbehaviours of investors in terms of their portfolio composition. The return\ndistributions can then be stipulated as arising from rational or irrational\ntrajectories and subsequently be simulated and matched via the proposed\nmodified Brownian Motion model to empirical return distributions in specific\ntime periods and markets.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Dr. Gurjeet Dhesi</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Mohammad Abdul Washad Emambocus</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Muhammad Bilal Shakeel</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">for improvement</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0342v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.0342v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1381v1</id>\n    <updated>2012-04-06T00:07:09Z</updated>\n    <published>2012-04-06T00:07:09Z</published>\n    <title>Price Jump Prediction in Limit Order Book</title>\n    <summary>  A limit order book provides information on available limit order prices and\ntheir volumes. Based on these quantities, we give an empirical result on the\nrelationship between the bid-ask liquidity balance and trade sign and we show\nthat liquidity balance on best bid/best ask is quite informative for predicting\nthe future market order's direction. Moreover, we define price jump as a sell\n(buy) market order arrival which is executed at a price which is smaller\n(larger) than the best bid (best ask) price at the moment just after the\nprecedent market order arrival. Features are then extracted related to limit\norder volumes, limit order price gaps, market order information and limit order\nevent information. Logistic regression is applied to predict the price jump\nfrom the limit order book's feature. LASSO logistic regression is introduced to\nhelp us make variable selection from which we are capable to highlight the\nimportance of different features in predicting the future price jump. In order\nto get rid of the intraday data seasonality, the analysis is based on two\nseparated datasets: morning dataset and afternoon dataset. Based on an analysis\non forty largest French stocks of CAC40, we find that trade sign and market\norder size as well as the liquidity on the best bid (best ask) are consistently\ninformative for predicting the incoming price jump.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Ban Zheng</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Eric Moulines</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Abergel</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">16 pages</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1381v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.1381v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1410v2</id>\n    <updated>2014-06-18T20:37:18Z</updated>\n    <published>2012-04-06T05:06:08Z</published>\n    <title>Patience vs. Impatience of Stock Traders</title>\n    <summary>  An ability to postpone one's execution without penalty provides an important\nstrategic advantage in high-frequency trading. To elucidate competition between\ntraders one has to formulate to a quantitative theory of formation of the\nexecution price from market expectations and quotes. This theory was provided\nin 2005 by Foucault, Kadan and Kandel. I derive asymptotic distribution of the\nbids/offers as a function of the ratio of patient and impatient traders using\nthe dynamic version of the Foucault, Kadan and Kandel dynamic Limit Order Book\n(LOB) model.\n  Dynamic version of the LOB model allows stylized but sufficiently realistic\nrepresentation of the trading markets. In particular, dynamic LOB allows\nsimulation of the distribution of execution times and spreads from\nhigh-frequency quotes. Significant analytic progress is made towards\nunderstanding of trading as competition for immediacy of execution between\ntraders. The results are qualitatively compared with empirical volume-at-price\ndistribution of highly liquid stocks.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Peter Lerner</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1410v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.1410v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6488v1</id>\n    <updated>2012-04-29T15:50:15Z</updated>\n    <published>2012-04-29T15:50:15Z</published>\n    <title>Optimal multifactor trading under proportional transaction costs</title>\n    <summary>  Proportional transaction costs present difficult theoretical problems in\ntrading algorithm design, on account of their lack of analytical tractability.\nThe author derives a solution of DT-NT-DT form for an arbitrary model in which\nthe the traded asset has diffusive dynamics described by one or more stochastic\nrisk factors.

In contrary to several models\nproposed and researched in literature, this model provides complete continuity\nin both time and price inherited from the stochastic PDE, and thus is\nparticularly suitable for the cases where transactions happen in an extremely\nfast pace, such as those delivered by high frequency traders (HFT's).\n  We first elaborate the precise definition of the model with its associated\nparameters, and show its existence and uniqueness from the related mathematical\nresults given a fixed set of parameters. Then we statistically derive parameter\nestimation schemes of the model using maximum likelihood and least\nmean-square-errors estimation methods under certain criteria such as AIC to\naccommodate to variant number of parameters . Finally as a typical economics\nand finance use case of the model we settle the investment optimization problem\nin both static and dynamic sense by analysing the stochastic (It\\^{o})\nevolution of the utility function of an investor or trader who takes the model\nand its parameters as exogenous.

We also derive an expression for the decay of\nmarket impact after a trade, and show how it can result in a better liquidation\nstrategy for an informed trader. We show how, in spite of auto-correlation in\norder-flow, prices can be martingales, and how price manipulation is ruled out\neven though the bare impact function is concave. We finally assess the cost of\nmarket impact and try to make a step towards optimal strategies.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Jonathan Donier</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">37 pages</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.4770v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.4770v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1824v1</id>\n    <updated>2013-01-09T12:16:22Z</updated>\n    <published>2013-01-09T12:16:22Z</published>\n    <title>Trust in foreseeing neighbours - a novel threshold model of financial\n  market</title>\n    <summary>  The three-state agent-based 2D model of financial markets in the version\nproposed by Giulia Iori in 2002 has been herein extended.

We capture the iterative\nnature of trading processes, which is critical in the dynamics of bid-ask pairs\nand the switching laws between different traders' types and their orders. In\ngeneral, after introducing the atomic trading scheme, we study a general\niterated trading process in both combinatorial and stochastic ways, and state a\nfew results on the stability of a dynamical trading system. We also study the\ncontrolled dynamics of the spread and the mid-price in an iterated trading\nsystem, when their movements, generated from the dynamics of bid-ask pairs, are\nassumed to be restricted within some extremely small ranges.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Shilei Wang</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.3233/AF-13027</arxiv:doi>\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/AF-13027\" rel=\"related\"/>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">27 pages</arxiv:comment>\n    <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Algorithm.

Our new model admits several state variables (e.g. market\nspread, stochastic volatility and intensities of market orders) provided the\nfull system is Markov. The solution of the corresponding HJB equation is exact\nin the case of zero inventory risk. The inventory risk enters into play in two\nways: a path-dependent penalty based on the volatility and a penalty at expiry\nbased on the market spread. We perform perturbation methods on the inventory\nrisk parameter and obtain explicitly the solution and its controls up to first\norder. We also include transaction costs; we show that the spread of the\nmarket-maker is widened to compensate the transaction costs, but the expected\ngain per traded spread remains constant. We perform several numerical\nsimulations to assess the effect of the parameters on the PNL, showing in\nparticular how the directional bet and the inventory risk change the shape of\nthe PNL density. Finally, we extend our results to the case of multi-aset\nmarket-making strategies; we show that the correct notion of inventory risk is\nthe L2-norm of the (multi-dimensional) inventory with respect to the inventory\npenalties.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Pietro Fodra</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Mauricio Labadie</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7177v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.7177v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0413v4</id>\n    <updated>2014-03-17T08:53:15Z</updated>\n    <published>2013-05-02T12:12:47Z</published>\n    <title>Permanent market impact can be nonlinear</title>\n    <summary>  There are two schools of thought regarding market impact modeling. On the one\nhand, seminal papers by Almgren and Chriss introduced a decomposition between a\npermanent market impact and a temporary (or instantaneous) market impact. This\ndecomposition is used by most practitioners in execution models. On the other\nhand, recent research advocates for the use of a new modeling framework that\ngoes down to the resilient dynamics of order books: transient market impact.\nOne of the main criticisms against permanent market impact is that it has to be\nlinear to avoid dynamic arbitrage. This important discovery made by Huberman\nand Stanzl and Gatheral favors the transient market impact framework, as linear\npermanent market impact is at odds with reality. In this paper, we reconsider\nthe point made by Gatheral using a simple model for market impact and show that\npermanent market impact can be nonlinear. Also, and this is the most important\npart from a practical point of view, we propose different statistics to\nestimate permanent market impact and execution costs that generalize the ones\nproposed in Almgren at al. (2005).\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Olivier Gu\u00e9ant</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0413v4\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.0413v4\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4013v7</id>\n    <updated>2017-05-08T23:13:50Z</updated>\n    <published>2013-05-17T08:38:45Z</published>\n    <title>A market impact game under transient price impact</title>\n    <summary>  We consider a Nash equilibrium between two high-frequency traders in a simple\nmarket impact model with transient price impact and additional quadratic\ntransaction costs. Extending a result by Sch\\\"oneborn (2008), we prove\nexistence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium and show that for small\ntransaction costs the high-frequency traders engage in a \"hot-potato game\", in\nwhich the same asset position is sold back and forth. We then identify a\ncritical value for the size of the transaction costs above which all\noscillations disappear and strategies become buy-only or sell-only. Numerical\nsimulations show that for both traders the expected costs can be lower with\ntransaction costs than without. Moreover, the costs can increase with the\ntrading frequency when there are no transaction costs, but decrease with the\ntrading frequency when transaction costs are sufficiently high. We argue that\nthese effects occur due to the need of protection against predatory trading in\nthe regime of low transaction costs.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Alexander Schied</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Tao Zhang</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4013v7\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.4013v7\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2073v1</id>\n    <updated>2013-06-09T23:22:15Z</updated>\n    <published>2013-06-09T23:22:15Z</published>\n    <title>A theoretical framework for trading experiments</title>\n    <summary>  A general framework is suggested to describe human decision making in a\ncertain class of experiments performed in a trading laboratory. We are in\nparticular interested in discerning between two different moods, or states of\nthe investors, corresponding to investors using fundamental investment\nstrategies, technical analysis investment strategies respectively. Our\nframework accounts for two opposite situations already encountered in\nexperimental setups: i) the rational expectations case, and ii) the case of\npure speculation. We consider new experimental conditions which allow both\nelements to be present in the decision making process of the traders, thereby\ncreating a dilemma in terms of investment strategy. Our theoretical framework\nallows us to predict the outcome of this type of trading experiments, depending\non such variables as the number of people trading, the liquidity of the market,\nthe amount of information used in technical analysis strategies, as well as the\ndividends attributed to an asset. We find that it is possible to give a\nqualitative prediction of trading behavior depending on a ratio that quantifies\nthe fluctuations in the model.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Maxence Soumare</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>J\u00f8rgen Vitting Andersen</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Francis Bouchard</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Alain Elkaim</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Dominique Gu\u00e9gan</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Justin Leroux</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Michel Miniconi</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Lars Stentoft</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2073v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.2073v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"q-fin.TR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2832v4</id>\n    <updated>2014-05-12T18:15:14Z</updated>\n    <published>2013-06-12T14:13:25Z</published>\n    <title>VWAP execution and guaranteed VWAP</title>\n    <summary>  Optimal liquidation using VWAP strategies has been considered in the\nliterature, though never in the presence of permanent market impact and only\nrarely with execution costs.
